# TypeScript Migration Notes

## Completed Tasks

1. **Converted core functionality to TypeScript**:
   - Converted CommonJS to ES modules
   - Added proper type annotations to all classes and functions
   - Implemented proper class structures with TypeScript syntax
   - Added proper type interfaces for all parameters and return values

2. **Implemented strict type checking**:
   - Properly typed method parameters and return values
   - Added type definitions for callback functions
   - Fixed null/undefined handling with optional chaining
   - Used correct typing for DOM/SVG manipulation

3. **Modularized the codebase**:
   - Moved class definitions to separate files
   - Created proper exports/imports
   - Implemented clean dependency structure
   - Added index exports for simplified imports

4. **Added comprehensive type definitions**:
   - Created interfaces for all options objects
   - Added proper typings for callback functions
   - Properly typed array and object structures
   - Documented parameter and return types

5. **Updated build system**:
   - Added TypeScript configuration
   - Used Bun for testing and building
   - Added proper ESM support

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Test Coverage**:
   - The test suite is now running with TypeScript and Bun's test runner, but some tests are still failing due to Jimp module integration issues.
   - Need to fix the Jimp import/usage in all files to ensure tests pass properly.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update JSDocs to use TypeScript-friendly format
   - Add more TypeScript-specific examples

3. **Performance optimization**:
   - Consider using more TypeScript-specific optimizations
   - Look for opportunities to use const assertions, readonly, etc.

## Migration Challenges

1. **Jimp Integration**:
   - Jimp module had to be imported differently for TypeScript
   - Had to properly type the Jimp callback functions

2. **Class Method Conversion**:
   - Converting from CommonJS prototype methods to TypeScript class methods required careful restructuring
   - Added proper access modifiers (private, public, etc.)

3. **External Module Types**:
   - Had to create proper typing for external dependencies
   - Added proper DOM/SVG type definitions

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining test cases by correcting the Jimp module usage
2. Add more comprehensive TypeScript examples
3. Add proper TypeScript documentation
4. Consider adding stricter type checking with noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks
